      <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">Terms and Conditions - Rentlify</h1>
      <div>
        1. Use of the Platform Rentlify is intended solely for hotel listings
        and bookings. Any misuse, unauthorized listings, or unrelated services
        are strictly prohibited. Users must be 18 years or older to register and
        use the Platform. You agree to provide accurate and complete information
        during the registration and booking process.
      </div>
      <div>
        2. Hotel Listings : Only legitimate property owners or authorized
        representatives may list hotels on Rentlify. You are responsible for the
        accuracy, availability, pricing, and all other details related to your
        hotel listing. Rentlify reserves the right to remove or suspend listings
        that violate our policies or receive repeated complaints.
      </div>
      <div>
        3. Bookings & Payments : When a user makes a booking, it becomes a
        legally binding agreement between the guest and the hotel owner. All
        payments must be made through Rentlify's secure payment gateway (e.g.,
        Stripe). Cancellation and refund policies are set by the individual
        hotel and must be clearly stated in each listing. Rentlify charges a
        small service fee per successful booking.
      </div>
      <div>
        4. User Conduct : Users must not use the platform for illegal or
        unethical purposes. Abusive language, fraud, or manipulation of the
        system will lead to immediate termination of access. Guests are expected
        to respect property rules and conduct themselves responsibly during
        stays.
      </div>
      <div>
        5. Liability : Rentlify acts as a marketplace and does not own or
        operate any listed properties. We are not liable for issues arising from
        the stay, including property condition, safety, or misrepresentation.
        However, we offer a dispute resolution process to help guests and hosts
        resolve booking issues.
      </div>
      <div>
        6. Modifications and Termination : Rentlify may update these Terms at any
        time. Continued use of the platform implies acceptance of any updated
        Terms. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate user accounts in
        case of policy violations or misuse.
